What Happens When You Type “https://www.google.com” in Your Browser and Press Enter?
When we type a website address like https://www.google.com into our browser and hit Enter, a fascinating sequence of events occurs behind the scenes. Let’s dive into the details of what happens during this process, covering various components of the web stack:

1. DNS Request (Domain Name System):
The journey begins with the browser breaking down the URL into pieces.
The browser first looks at the domain name part: google.com.
It needs to find the corresponding IP address for this domain.
It sends a DNS request to DNS servers (like an internet phonebook) to resolve the domain name into an IP address.
The DNS server responds with the exact IP address of the server that google.com points to.
2. TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol):
Armed with the IP address, your computer establishes a connection with the server using the TCP/IP protocol.
TCP ensures reliable data transmission by breaking data into packets, numbering them, and reassembling them at the destination.
IP handles routing and addressing, ensuring data reaches the correct server.
3. Firewall:
Before reaching the server, your request passes through any firewalls or security measures.
Firewalls filter incoming and outgoing traffic to protect against unauthorized access.
4. HTTPS/SSL (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure / Secure Sockets Layer):
If the website uses HTTPS, your browser initiates a secure connection.
It performs a TLS/SSL handshake with the server to establish an encrypted channel.
This ensures that data exchanged between your browser and the server remains confidential and secure.
5. Load Balancer:
For popular websites like Google, there are multiple servers handling requests.
A load balancer distributes incoming requests across these servers to maintain performance and prevent overload.
6. Web Server:
The request reaches the web server (in Google’s case, one of many).
The web server processes the request, retrieves the requested webpage, and sends it back to your browser.
7. Application Server:
Some websites have an application server that processes dynamic content (e.g., search results, personalized recommendations).
The application server generates the dynamic parts of the webpage.
8. Database:
If the webpage requires data from a database (e.g., search queries, user profiles), the application server queries the database.
The database retrieves the necessary information.
Conclusion:
Finally, your browser receives the webpage content, renders it, and displays it on your screen.
All these steps happen in a matter of seconds, allowing you to access the Google website seamlessly.
